% \PassOptionsToPackage{numbers, compress}{natbib}

% to compile a camera-ready version, add the [final] option, e.g.:
 \usepackage[final]{rl_project}

% to avoid loading the natbib package, add option nonatbib:

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\maketitle

\section{Problem Definition}
A clear, precise and concise description of your chosen problem,
including the states, actions, transition dynamics, and the reward function. You will lose
marks for an unclear, incorrect, or incomplete problem definition.

\section{Background}
A discussion of reinforcement learning methods that may be effective at solving
your chosen problem, their strengths and weaknesses for your chosen problem, and any existing
results in the scientific literature (or publicly available online) on your chosen problem or
similar problems.

\section{Method}
A description of the method(s) used to solve your chosen problem, an explanation
of how these methods work (in your own words), and an explanation of why you chose these
specific methods.

\section{Results}
A presentation of your results, showing how quickly and how well your agent(s)
learn (i.e. improve their policies). Include informative baselines for comparison (e.g. the best
possible performance, the performance of an average human, or the performance of an agent
that selects actions randomly).

\section{Discussion}
An evaluation of how well you solved your chosen problem.

\section{Future Work}
A discussion of potential future work you would complete if you had more
time.

\section{Personal Experience}
A discussion of your personal experience with the project, such as
difficulties or pleasant surprises you encountered while completing it.

\section*{Appendices}
If you have additional content that you would like to include in the appendices, please do so here.
There is no limit to the length of your appendices, but we are not obliged to read them in their entirety while marking. The main body of your report should contain all essential information, and content in the appendices should be clearly referenced where it's needed elsewhere.



Appendices should include (1) a detailed description of the problem domain,
including the states, actions, reward function, and transition dynamics; (2) all experimental
details so that the reader can fully replicate your experiments; and (3) how you selected your
hyperparameters (if applicable).
